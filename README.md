# Robust deep learning for emulating turbulent viscosities
###
### Abstract:
From the simplest models to complex deep neural networks, modeling turbulence with machine learning techniques still offers multiple challenges. In this context, the present contribution proposes a robust strategy using patch-based training to learn turbulent viscosity from flow velocities, and demonstrates its efficient use on the Spallart-Allmaras turbulence model. Training datasets are generated for flow past two-dimensional obstacles at high Reynolds numbers and used to train an auto-encoder type convolutional neural network with local patch inputs. Compared to a standard training technique, patch-based learning not only yields increased accuracy but also reduces the computational cost required for training.
